## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific challenge directory you want to attempt (e.g., `cd challenge-1`).
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that challenge's directory.

Each challenge is self-contained and includes its own Terraform configuration files.

Happy Terraforming!
